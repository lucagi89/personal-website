What is it?

This is my personal website, in it I show all my main interests and and important things of my life.
The website has a main landing page with an header on top containing all the links to my social media and github accounts, with a private message icon as well.
In the main section there is just a verse that I like and that is guiding me lately, with a picture of myself.
As you hover over the main section, all my interests will start to show themselves as images.
When you click on one of these images, it randers a page about its related topic, where I explain a bit of myself in regard of this topic, which could be a passion, a job or simply an interest.
At the bottom on the left there is a little home-icon that if pressed takes you back to the main page.
On the top left, together with the social media links, as I mentioned there is a message-icon that if pressed makes a little form pop-up on the page, to fill up with your details and a message.


How did I do the website?

I used of course Html, Css and Vanilla Javascript.
I worked mostly with Css, I tried to make the website as responsive as I could using 3 Media Queries to adapt the page on various sceen sizes. I used both Flexbox and Grid methods, because I want to practice them both, even if I know I probably didn't express their full potential at times.
There are still somethings that I would improve especially in the responsiveness side and also I should space up each topic-description in a better way. 

I used a good amount of Javascript as well because I don't really like hard coding much. I love using Javascript as much as possible, so I used it to render out each topic page.
I also used it to render and execute the message-form each time the form button is clicked
and I used it to re-render the home page every time the user needs to go back to it.
I created as well a second javascript file (message.js) to store all the data and messages coming from the message form.


Why did I do this website?

I tried to build the website emulating the meeting of a new person, at the beginning this person would only represent for us a face and maybe a conventional phrase, but as you spend time with that person and you chat with them touching different topics, you start understanding this person better.
I used a blue background because it's a color that I like.
The gray picture in the main page its related to the concept of the person to discover, and also I think It looks better than the colored one.
I used the pictures that I found in my gallery that I thought were the best fit for the topics, but unfortunately they are not professional pictures, sorry for that.
Overall I tried to make a website that I think I would like if it wasn't mine and I would come across to it randomly on the internet.
