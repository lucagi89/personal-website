What is it?

This is my personal website, in it I show all my main interests and and important things of my life.
The website has a main landing page with an header on top containing all the links to my social media and github accounts, with a private message icon as well.
In the main section there is just a phrase that I like and that is guiding me lately, with a picture of myself.
As you hover over the main section, all my interests will start to show themselves as images.
When you click on one of these images, it rander a page about its related topic, where I explain a bit of myself in regard of this topic, that could be a passion, a job or simply an interest.
At the bottom on the left there is a little home-icon that if pressed takes you back to the main page.
On the top left, together with the social media links, as I mentioned there is a message-icon that if pressed makes a little form pop-up on the page, to fill up with your details and a message.


How did I do the website?

I used of course Html, Css and Vanilla Javascript.
I worked mostly with Css, I tried to make the website as responsive as I could using 3 Media Queries to adapt the page on various sceen sizes. I used both Flexbox and Grid methods, because I want to practice them both, even if I know I probably didn't express their full potential at times.
There are still somethings that I would improve especially in the responsiveness side and also I should space up each topic-description in a better way. 

I used a good amount of Javascript as well because I don't really like big Html files. I love using Javascript as much as possible, so I used it to render out each topic page.
I also used it to render and execute the message-form each time the form button is clicked
and I used it to re-render the home page every time the user needs to go back to it.
I created as well a second javascript file (message.js) to store all the data and messages coming from the message form.
I could have used more Javascript, but I didn't want the Html file to be too "skinny".


Why did I do this website?

I tried to build the website emulating the meeting of a new person, at the beginning this person would only represent for us a face and maybe a conventional phrase, but as you spend time with that person and you chat with them touching different topics, you start understanding this person better.
I used a blue background because it's a color that I like.
The gray picture in the main page its related to the concept of the person to discover, and also I think It looks better than the colored one.
I used the pictures that I found in my gallery that I thought were the best fit for the topics, but unfortunately they are not professional pictures, sorry for that.
Overall I tried to make a website that I think I would like if it wasn't mine and I would come across to it randomly on the internet.


P.s. I tried to write as correctly as possible, but English is not my first lenguage, and if I made some mistakes writing, I hope you'll forgive me.

P.s.s. I attached a corrected-by-ChatGTP version of this README file if you feel more confortable reading that instead, but my version is more genuine for sure.






What is it?

This is my personal website where I showcase my main interests and important aspects of my life. The website features a main landing page with a header at the top that includes links to my social media and GitHub accounts, along with a private message icon. The main section consists of a phrase that I find meaningful and guiding, accompanied by a picture of myself. As you hover over the main section, my interests are displayed as images. Clicking on any of these images leads to a page dedicated to the related topic, where I share a bit about myself in relation to that specific interest, whether it's a passion, a job, or simply something I'm interested in. At the bottom left, there is a small home icon that, when clicked, takes you back to the main page. In the top left corner, along with the social media links I mentioned earlier, there is a message icon. Clicking on it triggers a pop-up form where you can enter your details and leave a message.

How did I create the website?

I used HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript for this website. While working on it, I primarily focused on CSS to make the website as responsive as possible. I utilized three media queries to ensure adaptability across various screen sizes. I employed both Flexbox and Grid methods, as I wanted to practice and familiarize myself with both approaches, even though I may not have fully utilized their potential at times. There are still a few areas I would like to improve, particularly in terms of responsiveness, and I should also enhance the spacing of each topic description.

I also incorporated a significant amount of JavaScript because I prefer to avoid large HTML files. I leveraged JavaScript to dynamically render each topic page, as well as to display and process the message form whenever the form button is clicked. Additionally, I used JavaScript to refresh the home page whenever the user needs to return to it. I created a separate JavaScript file called "message.js" to store all the data and messages submitted through the message form. Although I could have used more JavaScript, I wanted to strike a balance and avoid an overly minimal HTML file.

Why did I create this website?

I aimed to build the website to simulate meeting a new person. Initially, this person would only represent a face and perhaps a conventional phrase. However, as you spend time with them and engage in conversations covering various topics, you start to understand them better. I chose a blue background because it's a color I personally like. The grayscale picture on the main page symbolizes the person to be discovered, and I also believe it looks better than the colored version. I used the pictures from my gallery that I felt were the best fit for the respective topics, although I apologize that they are not professional-grade images. Overall, I aimed to create a website that I would enjoy if I stumbled upon it randomly on the internet, even if it weren't my own.

P.S. I made an effort to write as accurately as possible, but English is not my first language. If there are any mistakes, I hope you can forgive me.
