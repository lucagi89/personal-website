        <h1>Music has always been my main passion</h1>
        <div class='music-content'>
            <p>Since when I was a little kid, I was always fascinated by music, with my parents that would listen to a lot of different artists and genres.
            I really started to get into this world at 15, when I embraced a guitar and never left it since.
            In my twenties I played as a guitarist in various bands and projects, and I also started to write my own songs.
            Few years ago I had many songs that I had written, but never recorded them. So I decided that I was going to record them in a studio, but the problem is that I only had the voice and guitar part really defined.
            In a recording studio usually, the more time you take the more you pay, so I had to have drums, bass guitar and keyboard defined as well, so that I wouldnâ€™t have any doubts on how to record the song in the studio.
            As I downloaded an audio recording programme in my computer and started to record my songs, I notice that the quality was not bad at all, so eventually I decided to record everything myself.
            Since then, in my spare time I would sit in my home studio and record some music or jam with myself.</p>
